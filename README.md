# Urbanova – Super Mall Web Application 🛍️  
**Tagline**: *Shop Your Heart Out*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

🛒 Urbanova – Shop Your Heart Out
Urbanova is a web-based Super Mall portal that helps local merchants, especially from rural areas, bring their shops online.

Merchants reach out to a mall admin, who adds their shop details, offers, and products on their behalf. Then, users can visit the site, browse shops, view offers, filter by category or floor, and even compare products — just like in a real mall, but online.

This project is designed to digitally connect small sellers to a global audience, creating a bridge between local commerce and modern digital shopping.
